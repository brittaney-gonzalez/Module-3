        <p>The hardest part of wanting to change your body, is simply trying to figure out where to start. Establishing the goal is essential to the challenge. People need to know what to work for. Every goal is different, because it allows us to make a plan based on the desired end result.

            <p>One crucial part for any beginning is to write EVERYTHING down. Write down personal goals and a schedule that works for you. Having the goals in writing promotes personal accountability. Record the amount of times you plan on working out each week on a simple chart. It makes it easier to track progress as well.
